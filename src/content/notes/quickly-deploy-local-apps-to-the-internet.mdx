Here's a way to quickly deploy local applications to the internet using Cloudflare Tunnel, a command-line client that acts as a tunnel daemon to the internet using Cloudflare's network.

```bash
# 1. Install tool
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared

# 2. Login to Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# 3. Start your app (Ex. Node app)
npm run start

# 4. Expose local app to internet
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<LOCAL-PORT>

# Example url:
# https://grade-forty-methods-relief.trycloudflare.com
```
