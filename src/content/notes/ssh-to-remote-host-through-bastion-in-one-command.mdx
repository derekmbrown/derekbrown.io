Neat command I found to SSH into a remote host through a bastion in one command. This is possible using ProxyJump or the `-J` flag.

```bash
ssh -J <BASTION_IP> <REMOTE_IP>
```

If the hosts differ between users and ports, you can specify them like this.

```bash
ssh -J user@<BASTION_IP:PORT> user@<REMOTE_IP:PORT>
```
