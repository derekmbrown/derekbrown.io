[Astro](https://astro.build/), the framework I used to build this site, contains built-in support for [Shiki](https://shiki.style/), a syntax highlighter. 

[Here](https://shiki.style/themes) is a list of themes that work out-of-the-box!

I currently used the `github-dark ` theme for all code blocks on this site.
